ClojureScript Koans Vectors Answers

1)You can use vectors in clojure as array-like structures

(=  1  (count [42]))

2)You can create a vector from a list

(=  [1]  (vec '(1)))

3)Or from some elements

(=  [nil nil]  (vector nil nil))

4)But you can populate it with any number of elements at once

(= [1  2 ] (vec '(1 2)))

5)Conjoining to a vector is different than to a list

(=  [111 222 333]  (conj [111 222] 333))

6)You can get the first element of a vector like so

(=  :peanut  (first [:peanut :butter :and :jelly]))

7)And the last in a similar fashion

(=  :jelly  (last [:peanut :butter :and :jelly]))

8)Or any index if you wish

(=  :jelly  (nth [:peanut :butter :and :jelly] 3))

9)You can also slice a vector

(=  [:butter :and]  (subvec [:peanut :butter :and :jelly] 1 3))

10)Equality with collections is in terms of values

(= (list 1 2 3) (vector 1 2  3 ))
