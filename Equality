ClojureScript Koans Equality Answers

1) We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via equality

(=  true  true)

2) To understand reality, we must compare our expectations against reality

(=  2 (+ 1 1))

3) You can test equality of many things

(= (+ 3 4) 7 (+ 2  2 3 ))

4) But you may not string yourself along

(=  false  (= 2 "2"))

5) Something is not equal to nothing

(=  true  (not (= 1 nil)))

6) Strings, and keywords, and symbols: oh my!

(=  false  (= "foo" :foo 'foo))

7) Make a keyword with your keyboard

(= :foo (keyword  "foo"  ))

8) Symbolism is all around us

(= 'foo (symbol  "foo"  ))

9) When things cannot be equal, they must be different

(not= :fill-in-the-blank 
      :they-are-different  )
