(defn explain-defcon-level [exercise-term]
     (case exercise-term
           :fade-out          :you-and-what-army
           :double-take       :call-me-when-its-important

1)You will face many decisions

(=  :a  (if (false? (= 4 5)) :a :b))

2)Some of them leave you no alternative

(=  []  (if (> 4 3) []))

3)And in such a situation you may have nothing

(=  nil  (if (nil? 0) [:a :b :c]))

4)In others your alternative may be interesting

(= :glory (if (not (empty? ())) :doom  :glory ))

5)You may have a multitude of possible paths

(let [x 5] (= :your-road (cond (= x  4 ) :road-not-taken (= x  6 ) :another-road-not-taken :else  :your-road )))

6)Or your fate may be sealed

(=  'doom  (if-not (zero?  [] ) 'doom 'doom))

7)In case of emergency, sound the alarms

(= :sirens (explain-defcon-level  :cocked-pistol ))

8)But admit it when you don't know what to do

(=  :say-what?  (explain-defcon-level :yo-mama))
